# Agentic-RAG with LangChain and BM25 Retrieval

## Overview
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **LangChain** and **BM25** as the retrieval mechanism. The goal is to build an **agentic** RAG system that efficiently retrieves relevant documents and generates meaningful responses using LLMs.

## Features
- **BM25-based Retrieval**: Utilizes BM25, a ranking function used by search engines, for efficient document retrieval.
- **LangChain Integration**: Facilitates interaction with LLMs and document retrieval.
- **Agentic Behavior**: Uses LangChain’s agent-based capabilities for dynamic and context-aware responses.
- **Efficient Query Handling**: Processes user queries to retrieve and synthesize relevant information from a knowledge base.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **BM25 (Whoosh/Faiss)**
- **OpenAI GPT / Llama / Other LLMs**
- **Google Colab**

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Agentic-RAG-LangChain-BM25.git
   cd Agentic-RAG-LangChain-BM25
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Running the RAG System in Google Colab
1. Open Google Colab and upload the notebook `Agentic_RAG.ipynb`.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Modify inputs as required to test different queries.

```

## Customization
- Modify `retrieval.py` to fine-tune BM25 ranking parameters.
- Change `agent.py` to integrate different LLMs or prompt strategies.
- Add new data sources to the `data/` folder and re-index the documents.

## Future Enhancements
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combine BM25 with vector-based retrieval for better accuracy.
- **Fine-tuned LLM**: Use a custom-trained LLM for domain-specific responses.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Implement multiple agents for different query types.
- **Deployment**: Host on cloud platforms like AWS/GCP/Azure for scalability.
